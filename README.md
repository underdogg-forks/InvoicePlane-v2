```

### 4. Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations and seed database
php artisan migrate --seed
```

This creates:
- Default admin user
- Sample data (invoices, customers, products)
- Default roles and permissions

### 5. Build Assets

```bash
# Development build
yarn dev

# Production build
yarn build
```

### 6. Start Application

```bash
# Development server
php artisan serve

# Queue worker (required for export functionality)
php artisan queue:work
```

For production setup with Nginx/Apache, see [INSTALLATION.md](.github/INSTALLATION.md).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Queue Workers

Export functionality requires a queue worker to be running:

```bash
# Local development (sync queue)
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync

# Production (Redis recommended)
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
```

For production, use a process manager like Supervisor:

```ini
[program:invoiceplane-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /path/to/artisan queue:work redis --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=www-data
numprocs=8
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/path/to/worker.log
stopwaitsecs=3600
```

### Peppol Configuration

Peppol e-invoicing is **not yet implemented** on `develop` — see the [Peppol E-Invoicing](#-peppol-e-invoicing) section below for details and tracking issue.

---

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Tests

Tests run inside the Docker workspace container — the database is only reachable there:

```bash
# Run all tests
docker exec ivpldock-workspace-1 bash -c "cd /var/www/projects/ip2 && php artisan test"

# Run specific test file
docker exec ivpldock-workspace-1 bash -c "cd /var/www/projects/ip2 && php artisan test Modules/Invoices/Tests/Feature/InvoicesTest.php"

# Fall back to phpunit for full exception traces on failure
docker exec ivpldock-workspace-1 bash -c "cd /var/www/projects/ip2 && vendor/bin/phpunit Modules/Invoices/Tests/Feature/InvoicesTest.php"
```

Or use the Makefile shorthand (see `Makefile` for available targets).

**Preferred: Docker Compose.** The `cli` service runs the suite against a real MariaDB `db`
service — the same engine CI uses — with no setup beyond `docker compose run`:

```bash
docker compose run --rm cli php artisan test --exclude-group failing,troubleshooting
```

Use `php artisan test`, not `vendor/bin/phpunit` directly — the two have been observed to behave
differently for this app's Livewire form tests (`vendor/bin/phpunit` silently drops submitted
field values in some environments); `artisan test` is the reliable one and matches CI. A
freshly-rebuilt `cli` image has, at least once, reproduced this same problem even under
`artisan test` for reasons not yet isolated — see
[#689](https://github.com/InvoicePlane/InvoicePlane-v2/issues/689) before trusting a full run.

SQLite is intentionally not used for this project's tests: its lenient identifier quoting has
masked real bugs that only surfaced on MariaDB in CI. See `.github/DOCKER.md`.

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Laravel Pint
vendor/bin/pint

# Run static analysis
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Run Rector for automated refactoring
vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run
```

### Asset Development

```bash
# Development build with hot reload
yarn dev

# Production build
yarn build

# Watch for changes
yarn dev --watch
```

### Database Seeding

```bash
# Seed all seeders
php artisan db:seed

# Seed specific seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=InvoiceSeeder

# Fresh migration with seeding
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

See [SEEDING.md](.github/SEEDING.md) for custom seeding.

## 📦 Module Structure

All business logic lives under `Modules/` (via `nwidart/laravel-modules`), not in `app/`. The root `app/` directory is intentionally thin — it exists only for framework bootstrapping (`app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`); `app/Http/Controllers/` is empty because routing is handled entirely by Filament panel providers.

There are 8 modules today: `Core`, `Clients`, `Invoices`, `Quotes`, `Payments`, `Products`, `Projects`, and `Expenses`. Every module follows the same internal layout:

```
Modules/<Name>/
  Database/{Factories,Migrations,Seeders}/
  Models/
  Filament/{Admin,Company}/Resources/<Resource>/{Pages,Tables,Schemas}/
  Services/
  Enums/
  Events/ Listeners/ Observers/
  Traits/ Helpers/
  Http/{Controllers,Requests,Middleware}/
  Providers/
  Tests/{Unit,Feature}/
```

- **`Filament/Admin/...`** and **`Filament/Company/...`** hold the resources/pages registered on the two main Filament panels (see [Panel Access](#-panel-access) below).
- **`Services/`** hold the business-logic layer — services extend `Modules\Core\Services\BaseService` and accept/return plain arrays and Eloquent models (there is no separate DTO layer).
- **`Tests/Unit`** and **`Tests/Feature`** are discovered automatically by PHPUnit across all modules (see `phpunit.xml`); there's no central `tests/` directory at the project root.

Before adding a new resource/model/service, check the [Module Checklist](.github/CHECKLIST.md) to avoid duplicating something that already exists in another module.

### Panel Access

InvoicePlane v2 registers three Filament panels:

| Panel | URL path | Tenanted | Typical users |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Admin** | `/admin` | No | Super admins, admins, assistants |
| **Company** | `/{search_code}` (root) | Yes — scoped to `Company` by `search_code` | Company admins and customers |
| **User** | `/user` | No | Reserved for future use |

The company panel has no fixed `/company` path — it is tenant-scoped and the tenant's `search_code` (lowercased) is the first URL segment, e.g. `/ivplv2/dashboard` for the seeded default company.

---

## 🧪 Testing

InvoicePlane v2 includes comprehensive PHPUnit tests:

### Test Structure

```
Modules/
  ├── Invoices/Tests/
  │   ├── Unit/          # Unit tests
  │   ├── Feature/       # Feature tests
  │   └── Integration/   # Integration tests
  ├── Quotes/Tests/
  └── ...
```

### Writing Tests

All tests follow these conventions:
- Test methods start with `it_` (e.g., `it_creates_invoice`)
- Use `#[Test]` attribute
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Extend appropriate base test case

Example:

```php
#[Test]
public function it_creates_invoice(): void
{
    /* Arrange */
    $customer = Customer::factory()->create();
    
    /* Act */
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create(['customer_id' => $customer->id]);
    
    /* Assert */
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('invoices', ['id' => $invoice->id]);
}
```

## 📧 Peppol E-Invoicing

**Status: not yet implemented on `develop`.** `Modules/Invoices/Config/config.php` defines an extensive configuration tree for a planned multi-format Peppol integration, but there is currently no consuming PHP code anywhere in the repository — no `PeppolService`, no provider adapters, nothing wired into the invoice send flow. The real implementation work lives on the unmerged branch `feature/126-implement-peppol`, tracked by issue [#126](https://github.com/InvoicePlane/InvoicePlane-v2/issues/126).

If you're looking to contribute Peppol support, start with that issue and branch rather than the config file alone — the config schema exists, but the format handlers, access-point client, and UI wiring described in earlier drafts of this README were aspirational and have been removed here until they actually ship.
